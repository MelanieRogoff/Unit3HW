# Unit3HW


This assigment focuses on creating a randomized password generator. This password generator is coded in HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 4, and JavaScript.

The password generator focuses on:

* Ensuring users can create secure passwords by verifying that they create a password with anywhere from 8 to 128 characters, as well as veryifying that they create a password that utilizes at least one of the following: special characters (ie. "!"), numerical characters (ie. "1"), uppercase characters (ie. "A"), and lowercase characters (ie. "a").

* Allowing users to generate their password by clicking on the Generate Password button, and allowing users to copy their password to their clipboard by clicking on the Copy to Clipboard button.

* Upon completion of the pop-up prompts/confirms, users will see a special background pattern and have the ability to play music (song arranged by Melanie Rogoff) by clicking the triangle button near the bottom of the screen.
